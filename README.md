# Power-bi-Dashboard
## The purpose of this repository:
  I have created this repository to show the projects that I have made using Power Bi software, so it will be as a portfolio to represent my works.
  All the files are in the .pbix extension, so you need to download them and open using Power bi.
  You can also take a look at my portfolio on Maven Analytics via this link: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/profile/ali-housein/132827688

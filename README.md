# Power-bi-Dashboard
## The purpose of this repository:
  I have created this repository to show the projects that I have made using Power Bi software, so it will be as a portfolio to represent my works.
  All the files are in the .pbix extension, so you need to download them and open using Power bi, but I have added a PDF for each file (with the same file name) to take a look at the file's content.
